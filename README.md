## Description

This application is designed to allow the user to integrate tasks, appointments, reminders and more into 
a calendar. This calendar will then remind the user of the items input at a desired interval and also help
show the user how much time needs to be allocated to accomplish that task on time. 

A lot of us struggle with time management. The goal of this application is to aid those in need of more
structure and guidance into managing their time, as well as, those who just simply want reminders to keep
themselves on track.

## Credits
For the Apps front end we used React.js and React-big-calendar (https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar) along with Google's calendar(https://developers.google.com/calendar) and map (https://developers.google.com/maps) api. We also used the open weather map api for the weather widget portions (https://openweathermap.org/). We built our back end server using MongoDB(https://www.mongodb.com/) and Express(https://expressjs.com/) along with the mongoose npm package(https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose).  We would also like to thank Bryan Swarthout and Wilson Lam for their support on knowledge, without them this project would be very differnt.

## Description

This application is designed to allow the user to integrate tasks, appointments, reminders and more into 
a calendar. This calendar will then remind the user of the items input at a desired interval and also help
show the user how much time needs to be allocated to accomplish that task on time. 

A lot of us struggle with time management. The goal of this application is to aid those in need of more
structure and guidance into managing their time, as well as, those who just simply want reminders to keep
themselves on track.
